# PowerShell Runspaces Deep Dive (the follow-along)

## Abstract

You may have heard of runspaces as a way to speed up your PowerShell code, but the examples and concepts you've seen online are weird and ugly. Did you know in any script you're using runspaces already and you don't even know it?

Join Jordan Borean and Justin Grote as they explain the concept of runspaces, and how runspace management has many benefits (and many caveats!) in PowerShell scripting. Various techniques for using runspaces as well as alternatives will be discussed. We will also cover the sometimes difficult topic of debugging runspaces as well.

As a follow-along session, this presentation will use Github Codespaces to enable you to try out these advanced parallelism techniques as we go!
